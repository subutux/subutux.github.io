Unrelated to this, buit it seems there is an issue with my local vaultwarden instance.
But this got me thinking. What if my local mqtt server goes down..
I am running a local mosquitto server on my OpenWRT router (A Mikrotik 750Gr3) to support my growing love for home automation. Normally this should be quite stable, but I had issues with OpenWRT in the past.</description></item></channel></rss>
